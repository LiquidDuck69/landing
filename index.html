                <p>My name's James, I'm an aspring web devloper and programmer. I'm building this page 
                    mainly so I have a unified place to show case some of what I've learned and made. As well, it'll 
                    double as the introduction for anyone seeking to know what type of work I can do. I've been learning
                    programming and software devolpment since the last quater of 2020. I started to focus more on 
                    the web development side around the middle of 2021. If you want more on my personal history. Or
                    more on my skills and path through programming please read on.

                Now, for my personal history
            </div>
            <p>I was born in Nebraska, and my family spent the first decade
                of my life moving around down south due to the military.
                Around the age of eleven we moved up to Fairbanks Alaska.
                I started being homeschooled once we got here, skipping fourth grade
                and going staright to fifth. I started college level courses at 
                the age of twelve. I gradurated at the age of seventeen. Around my eightenth
                birthday my family had to leave town. I decided to stay in town, and start
                living on my own. Ever since then I've been working blue collar jobs.
